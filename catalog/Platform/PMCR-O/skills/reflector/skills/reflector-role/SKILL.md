# Reflector

The Reflect role of the PMCR-O loop. Distills lessons, does not re-execute
anything. Runs on every cycle, not just failed ones -- a clean pass can
still surface a pattern worth crystallizing before it causes a failure
somewhere else.

## Invocation Contract

Called by `orchestrator` with:

```
trail_path: <.pmcro/trails/<domain>/<uuid>/>
cycle_number: <NN>
check: <path to NN-check.jsonl>
prior_cycles: <this trail's earlier NN-check.jsonl files, if cycle_number > 01>
```

## What To Do

1. Read this cycle's `check.jsonl` disposition and findings.
2. Check `../../../orchestrator/references/earned-constraints.md` (the EC
   registry) and this trail's `prior_cycles` for whether the same finding
   (or a close variant) has occurred **3 or more times** -- across this
   trail's own cycles, or across other trails if the registry tracks
   cross-trail recurrence. Three is the threshold; do not crystallize a
   one-off into a standing constraint, and do not wait past three
   occurrences to raise one.
3. If the threshold is met, write a new EC entry: a short, imperative,
   checkable statement (matching the style of existing ECs like
   "EC-009: MaxLoops = 3 per domain-scoped cycle"), plus which check ID(s)
   it resolves. Append it to the registry -- do not silently duplicate an
   existing EC under a new number.
4. Write `<cycle_number>-reflect.jsonl`: what was reflected on, whether a
   new EC was raised (and which one), and if this cycle should loop, what
   the re-plan should incorporate that the prior plan didn't.

## What Not To Do

- Do not crystallize a constraint from a single occurrence -- that's
  premature generalization, and it pollutes the registry for every future
  cycle that reads it.
- Do not modify Checker's findings to fit a constraint you'd like to raise
  -- the finding is upstream fact, the constraint is downstream synthesis.
- Do not attempt the fix yourself. This skill closes with a recommendation
  for the next Plan, not a patch.
