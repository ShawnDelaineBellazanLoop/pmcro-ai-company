# Skill Creator (Colony Packaging)

Packages new Colony capability into this repo's existing convention. Does
not decide *whether* something should be built (that's upstream, in
`/ceo:evolve-colony`'s routing + orchestrator-workers steps) and does not
*publish* what it packages (that's downstream, gated by
`/ceo:approve-initiative`). This skill's entire job is the middle: turn an
approved shape into a correctly-structured package on disk.

## Invocation Contract

```
shape: command | agent | domain | role-skill
target_package: <existing package this attaches to, or new package name>
spec: <what the new command/agent/domain/role-skill should do>
repo_path: <resolved per Law 1>
```

## Before Writing Anything

Invoke `dependency-resolver` with `needs: <target_package>` to confirm the
target package actually exists (for `command`/`agent` shapes) or that the
proposed new package name doesn't collide with an existing
`pmcro_provides` value (for `domain`/`role-skill` shapes).

## Packaging By Shape

### `command`
Add `<target_package>/commands/<name>.md` matching the exact frontmatter
shape already in use across this repo: a `description` field with a
`Usage:` line, then a body starting "Dispatch a PMCR-O cycle scoped to the
`<domain>` domain" and a `true_intent:` block. See any existing file under
`catalog/Tools/AI-Company/skills/*/commands/` for the pattern to match
verbatim, not approximately.

### `agent`
Add `<target_package>/agents/<name>.md` with `name`, `description`,
`tools`, and `model` frontmatter, matching `ceo/agents/agent-router.md`'s
shape.

### `domain`
Full new package under `catalog/Tools/AI-Company/skills/<name>/`:
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `manifest.json`,
`skills/domain-scope/SKILL.md` (with explicit Owns/Does Not Own per Law 4),
`commands/`, `agents/`.

### `role-skill`
Full new package under `catalog/Platform/PMCR-O/skills/<name>/`, same
layout as `planner`/`maker`/`checker`/`reflector` -- passive, stateless,
`metadata.pmcro_provides`/`pmcro_requires` declared, no sequencing logic of
its own. This is the shape `/ceo:evolve-colony` would use if a gap turns
out to need a genuinely new PMCR-O role rather than fitting one of the
existing four.

## After Packaging: Sync the Catalog (never partially)

Per this repo's own standing rule (mirrored from the earlier `pmcro-cline`
project's discipline: `SKILL-REGISTRY.md`/`SKILLS.yaml` always update
together), these three files change **together, in the same commit**, or
not at all:

1. `catalog/skills.json` -- add the new entry, schema-valid against
   `catalog/skills.schema.json`
2. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` -- add the plugin entry (Claude Code
   native format)
3. `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` -- add the same entry in the Codex
   twin format

Use `../../commands/update-catalog.md` to do this rather than hand-editing
each file separately -- it's the one place that enforces all three change
together. See `../../references/marketplace-schema-notes.md` for the
current marketplace.json fields (`version`, `renames`, `hooks`,
`mcpServers`, `lspServers`) worth setting on new entries.

## Validate Before Handing Back

Run `claude plugin validate .` (checks Claude Code's own marketplace
schema) **and** confirm `catalog/skills.json` against
`catalog/skills.schema.json` (a different surface -- both must pass, one
passing doesn't imply the other does). See
`../../commands/validate-skill.md`.

## Hard Stop

This skill hands its output back as `needs-approval`, never writes it as
`accept`. Whatever invoked this skill (an `orchestrator`-run
`evolve-colony` cycle) is responsible for sealing the trail that way and
routing to `/ceo:approve-initiative` -- packaging correctly is not the same
as being approved to publish.
